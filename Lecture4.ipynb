In another cell, check if you have access to the variable named `word`? *Note that you must have the Jupyter notebook open in the same directory where \"Test.py\" is saved. To check, type* `ls` *in a notebook code cell, you should see an output of the current working directory listing and \"Test.py\" should be listed here.*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Now restart the Kernel and try `import Test` in another cell of the notebook. Do you have access to the variable `word` from this import? Try the 'dot' notation i.e. type `Test.` and then use the Tab key to see available completions. \n",
    "\n",

    "5. Finally, open \"Test.py\" in your text editor and change the string in the variable `word` to something different. Try `run Test.py` and `import Test` again. What do you notice?\n",
